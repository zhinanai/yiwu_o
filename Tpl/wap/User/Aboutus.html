                    一个好的点子，可以使一个企业起死回生，生意兴隆；可以使一个政治家在政坛角逐中取得成功，飞黄腾达；可以使一个军事家绝处逢生，转败为胜。作为一个普通人，在日常生活和工作中也离不开点子。一个好点子，可以使一个普通人的生活如鱼得水，游刃有余；可以使一个普通人的事业蒸蒸日上、兴旺发达。

                    金点子，是美国沃克数字公司搭建的世界级点子交易平台。1994年，杰伊·沃克(Jay Walker) 成立了沃克数字公司，并拥有它90%的股份。这实际上是一个知识产权实验室，是仿照大发明家爱迪生的实验室而建立。爱迪生一直是沃克先生崇拜的偶像，但沃克先生认为爱迪生的1063件发明获得专利权虽然了不起，却没有为他带来超级财富，身后只留下1200万美元(相当于今天的1.3亿美元)遗产。这太不正常了！沃克先生认定聪明人应该大富大贵，于是他致力于把沃克数字打造成新技术发明和新商业模式的孵化器：“点子工厂”。
                    爱迪生以前，科学发明和发现都是发明家个人努力的结果。沃克先生改变了这种定式。沃克数字公司的员工一半是发明家，大多数是30岁出头的硕士，来自不同的学科，另一半员工是经验丰富的专利律师。大家每周来一次“头脑风暴”，寻找可以基于互联网的问题解决方案。公司专注的是商业流程专利，即“不是销售什么产品，而是如何销售它们”。沃克先生把这些商业模式、商业经营策略注册成为专利，独家拥有！他要么利用这些专利成立新公司，要么将其授权给其他公司收取专利使用费。目前，沃克先生已经成为450多件专利的拥有者，是世界上拥有专利最多的人之一。他的专利已经在15个不同行业得到应用，服务于7500万个顾客。很多记者都好奇：沃克先生为何能够发明这么多的专利，拥有这么多的商业灵感。或许从沃克先生的私人图书馆“人类想象历史沃克图书馆 ”中，人们能找到答案。它位于美国东北部康涅狄格州，是一座3层楼高、近330平方米的私人图书馆。与其说它是个图书馆，倒不如说它是个博物馆。除了书籍以外，里面随处可见沃克先生收集的能够代表人类发明成果的发明原件或复制品，包括苏联第一颗人造地球卫星的备用星原件、美国国家航空航天局实验飞机X―29、纳粹的密码机、3亿年前的动物化石、最古老的纸本《圣经》以及各种稀奇古怪的玩意儿。沃克先生表示：让自己被前人的伟大发明包围，有助于激发发明灵感、增强挑战新兴领域的勇气和信心。
                    《时代》杂志曾两次将沃克先生评为“数字时代最有影响力的50位商业领袖”。《商业周刊》也曾评沃克先生为“25位互联网最有影响力的人物”。沃克先生则充满信心地表示：“沃克数字公司要对未来的商业进行基因改良，我们甚至可以发明出许多新的行业”。或许，这就是创新的魅力。

                    Ideas can also be sold as products and are highly profitable.

                    A good idea can bring a business back to life. It can make a politician succeed in the political competition. Can make a military strategist desperate, turn defeat into victory. As an ordinary person, I can't live without ideas in my daily life and work. A good idea can make an ordinary person's life as easy as fish and water. It can make an ordinary person's career prosperous and flourishing.  </p>
                <br>

                    Ideas are undoubtedly the shining pearl in the treasure house of human thought.

                    Golden idea is a world-class idea trading platform built by walker digital. Jay Walker founded Walker digital in 1994 and owns 90 percent of it. It's actually an intellectual property lab, modeled after the lab of the great inventor Thomas Edison. Edison has long been an icon to Mr. Walker, but Mr. Walker argues that his patent on 1,063 inventions, while remarkable, did not bring him a great fortune, leaving him with a legacy of $12 million (the equivalent of $130 million today). It's not normal! Mr Walker decided that smart people should be rich, so he turned walker's Numbers into an incubator for new technological inventions and new business models: the idea factory.

                    Before Edison, scientific inventions and discoveries were the result of individual efforts of inventors. Mr Walker has changed that formula. Half of the workers at walker digital are inventors, most are masters in their early 30s, come from different disciplines, and the other half are experienced patent lawyers. Brainstorm once a week to find a solution to a problem that could be based on the Internet. Companies focus on business process patents, which say "" not what products are sold, but how they are sold" ". Mr. Walker registered these business models, business strategies as patents, exclusive ownership! He either USES the patents to form new companies or licenses them to other companies to collect royalty payments. Mr Walker is now the owner of more than 450 patents, one of the most in the world. His patents have been applied in 15 different industries, serving 75 million customers. Many journalists wondered why Mr Walker could invent so many patents and have so many business ideas. Perhaps the answer lies in Mr Walker's private library, the walker library of human imagination. Located in the northeastern state of Connecticut, it is a three-story private library of nearly 330 square meters. It is more a museum than a library. In addition to books, it can be seen everywhere walker collect to represent human inventions the invention of the original or copy, including the Soviet union's first man-made earth satellite in the original standby star, NASA experimental aircraft X - 29, Nazi password machine, 300 million years ago animal fossils, the oldest printed bibles and all sorts of strange things. Mr Walker says that by surrounding yourself with the great inventions of our predecessors, it helps to inspire invention and boost the courage and confidence to challenge emerging fields.

                    Time magazine twice named Mr Walker "the 50 most influential business leaders of the digital age". Businessweek has also called Mr Walker "the 25 most influential people on the Internet". "We can even invent new industries," says Mr Walker. Perhaps that is the magic of innovation.</p>
